# Breast cancer Detection

**Project Status: In Progress**

The Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems at University of California, Irvine has a rich collection of <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html">datasets</a> that is publicly available. 

In this project, I explore the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The goal of the project is to build a model that can classify a cancer tumor as benign or malignant based on attritubes such as the thickness of the clump. 

More details about the dataset can be found <a href=https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29>here</a>.
